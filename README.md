####   WHAT IS ACID   ####
-----------------------------------------
The initial setup of ACI can be a painful and confusing process due to the overwhelming use of object-oriented configurations and the many steps needed to perform a baseline setup. Using the raw API with something like PostMan is not much better. Acid is designed to get you through that process quickly and painlessly.
